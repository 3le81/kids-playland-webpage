### 💡 **Inspiration Behind the Project:**
I thought of creating **Kids Playland** when my son was 4 years old. We loved making up games together on paper, and it was one of our favorite ways to spend time. This sparked the idea of writing a simple game for him to play with-one that could bring the same fun and learning experience we had together into a digital space.

### 3. **Guess the Number Game:**
   - A guessing game where kids try to guess a random number between 1 and 100. It promotes logical reasoning and problem-solving.
